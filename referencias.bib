We show that that our performance is sufficient to make live migration a practical tool even for servers running interactive loads.In this paper we consider the design options for migrating OSes running services with liveness constraints, focusing on data center and cluster environments. We introduce and analyze the concept of writable working set, and present the design, implementation and evaluation of high-performance OS migration built on top of the Xen VMM.},

The industry also has not fully leveraged the parallel trend of decentralized renewable energy generation, which creates new areas of opportunity for innovation in combined energy and computing systems. Through an interdisciplinary sociotechnical discussion of current energy, computer science and social studies of science and technology (STS) literature, we argue that a more comprehensive set of carbon response techniques needs to be developed that span the continuum of data centers, from the back-end cloud to the network edge. Such techniques need to address the combined needs of decentralized energy and computing systems, alongside the social power dynamics those combinations entail. We call this more comprehensive range “carbon-responsive computing,” and underscore that this continuum constitutes the beginnings of an interconnected infrastructure, elements of which are data-intensive and require the integration of social science disciplines to adequately address problems of inequality, governance, transparency, and definitions of “necessary” tasks in a climate crisis.},

  abstract          = {Most Cloud providers support services under constraints of Service Level Agreement (SLA) definitions. The SLAs are composed of different quality of service (QoS) rules promised by the provider. Thus, the QoS in Clouds becomes more and more important. Precise definitions and metrics have to be explained. This article proposes an overview of Cloud QoS parameters as well as their classification, but also it defines usable metrics to evaluate QoS parameters. Moreover, the defined QoS metrics are measurable and reusable in any scheduling approach for Clouds. The use of these QoS models is done through the performance analysis of three scheduling approaches considering four QoS parameters. In addition to the energy consumption and the Response Time, two other QoS parameters are taken into account in different virtual machines scheduling approaches. These parameters are dynamism and robustness, which are usually not easily measurable. The evaluation is done through simulations, using two common scheduling algorithms and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for virtual machines (VMs) reallocation, allowing us to analyze the QoS parameters evolution in time. Simulation results have shown that including various and antagonist QoS parameters allows a deeper analysis of the intrinsic behavior and insight of these three algorithms. Also, it is shown that the multi-objective optimization allows the service provider to seek the best trade-off between service performances and end user's experience. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract          = {Energy efficiency of cloud data centers is of great concern today and has been tackled by many researchers. Dynamic VM placement is a well-known strategy to improve energy efficiency of a data center. Virtual machines (VMs) under light load are consolidated into a small number of physical machines (PMs) to turn idle PMs into low-power states. Although live migration is essential for dynamic VM placement, former studies have not yet revealed how energy overhead of live migration has impact on energy efficiency of dynamic VM placement. To tackle this problem, we conducted integrated simulation of energy overhead of live migration and dynamic VM placement sing Sim Grid. We used three dynamic VM placement policies and two live migration mechanisms (existing pre-copy and an accelerated mechanism invented by us) to thoroughly evaluate the energy overhead. The results showed that in the worst case energy overhead of live migration occupies 5.8% of total energy consumption of a data center. © 2014 IEEE.},

In order to get an approximately optimal solution, we adopt the hybrid genetic algorithm combined with knapsack problem with multiple fitness and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

  abstract          = {In modern data centres (DCs), energy consumption and resource management are challenging tasks. So in large virtualized DCs, performance of applications is highly dependent on energy-Aware DC architecture and smooth network communication between virtual machines (VMs), while minimizing the communication burden to avoid congestion, latency etc. The communication cost of a network can be reduced by minimizing the VMs migration between physical machines (PMs). Therefore customer as well as service providers need cloud computing solutions that not only minimize operational costs, but also total network load. Minimizing the use of energy/network communication overhead with maximum resource utilization in large DCs is a challenging task as computing applications and data are growing so quickly for which increasing larger servers and disks are required to process them fast enough within the required time period. In order to minimize network load and maximize resource utilization in cloud DCs, we simulated our proposed network load-Aware scheduling algorithm that ensures minimum VMs migration while delivering the negotiated Quality-of-Service (QoS). Our simulation also shows results with different bit rates. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Reducing energy consumption in cloud data center is a complex task, where both computation and network related effects must be taken into account. While existing solutions aim to reduce energy consumption considering separately computational and communication contributions, limited attention has been devoted to models integrating both parts. We claim that this lack leads to a sub-optimal management in current cloud data centers, that will be even more evident in future architectures characterized by Software-Defined Network approaches. In this paper, we propose a joint computation-plus-communication model for Virtual Machines (VMs) allocation that minimizes energy consumption in a cloud data center. The contribution of the proposed model is threefold. First, we take into account data traffic exchanges between VMs capturing the heterogeneous connections within the data center network. Second, the energy consumption due to VMs migrations is modeled by considering both data transfer and computational overhead. Third, the proposed VMs allocation process does not rely on weight parameters to combine the two (often conflicting) goals of tightly packing VMs to minimize the number of powered-on servers and of avoiding an excessive number of VM migrations. An extensive set of experiments confirms that our proposal, which considers both computation and communication energy contributions even in the migration process, outperforms other approaches for VMs allocation in terms of energy reduction. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This results in the adoption of data centers which store, process and present the data in a seamless, efficient and easy way. Furthermore, it also consumes an enormous amount of electrical energy, then leads to high using cost and carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, we need a Green computing solution that can not only minimize the using costs and reduce the environment impact but also improve the performance.

We propose an adaptive underloading detection method of hosts, VMs migration selecting method and heuristic algorithm for dynamic consolidation of VMs based on the analysis of the historical data.

Therefore, we require to develop techniques which will help to get more environment friendly computing i.e. Green Cloud Computing. In this paper, we propose a new technique to reduce the carbon emission and energy consumption in the distributed cloud datacenters having different energy sources and carbon footprint rates. Our approach uses the carbon footprint rate of the datacenters in distributed cloud architecture and the concept of virtual machine allocation and migration for reducing the carbon emission and energy consumption in the federated cloud system. Simulation results show that our proposed approach reduces the carbon dioxide emission and energy consumption of federated cloud datacenters as compared to the classical scheduling approach of round robin VM scheduling in federated cloud datacenters. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Cloud data centers consume an enormous amount of energy. Virtual Machine (VM) migration technology can be applied to reduce energy consumption by consolidating VMs onto the minimal number of servers and turn idle servers into power-saving modes. While most existing energy models consider mainly computing energy, an enhanced energy consumption model is formulated, which includes energy consumption for computation, for servers to switch from standby to active modes, and for communication during VM migrations. Next, two new dynamic VM migration algorithms are proposed. They apply a local regression method to predict potentially over-utilized servers, and the 0-1 knapsack dynamic programming to find the best-fit combination of VMs for migration. The time complexity of these algorithms is analyzed, which indicates that they are highly scalable. Performance is evaluated and compared with existing algorithms. The two new heuristics have significantly reduced the number of VM migration, the number of rebooted servers, and energy consumption. Furthermore, one of them has achieved the least overall SLA violations. We believe that the new energy formulation and the two new heuristics contribute significantly towards achieving green cloud computing. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Virtualized datacenters and clouds are being increasingly considered for traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads that have typically targeted Grids and conventional HPC platforms. However, maximizing energy efficiency and utilization of datacenter resources, and minimizing undesired thermal behavior while ensuring application performance and other Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for HPC applications requires careful consideration of important and extremely challenging tradeoffs. Virtual Machine (VM) migration is one of the most common techniques used to alleviate thermal anomalies (i. e., hotspots) in cloud datacenter servers as it reduces load and, hence, the server utilization. In this article, the benefits of using other techniques such as voltage scaling and pinning (traditionally used for reducing energy consumption) for thermal management over VM migrations are studied in detail. As no single technique is the most efficient to meet temperature/performance optimization goals in all situations, an autonomic approach that performs energy-efficient thermal management while ensuring the QoS delivered to the users is proposed. To address the problem of VM allocation that arises during VM migrations, an innovative application-centric energy-aware strategy for Virtual Machine (VM) allocation is proposed. The proposed strategy ensures high resource utilization and energy efficiency through VM consolidation while satisfying application QoS by exploiting knowledge obtained through application profiling along multiple dimensions (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth utilization). To support our arguments, we present the results obtained from an experimental evaluation on real hardware using HPC workloads under different scenarios. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Additionally, we analyze the efficiency of parallel migration strategy and workload-aware migration strategy. The metrics such as downtime, total migration time, and workload performance overheads are measured. Experiments reveal some new discovery of live migration of multiple virtual machines.

To save energy in cloud data centers, dynamic virtual machine consolidation can be thought of one of the best methods. In this approach, some of the under-loaded physical machines (PMs)are put either into low-power mode or are switched-off with the help of live migration of Virtual Machines(VMs). But the number of migrations may also produce more Carbon dioxide emissions and indirectly much energy is consumed. To avoid this situation, clustering of PMs can be done and these clusters can be assigned to the respective consolidation managers. Consolidation of VM is strictly NP-hard problem, so, we are using the hybrid of metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The hybrid of algorithms is expected to produce better results in terms of number of migrations and energy consumption.

Both of the proposed algorithms are formulated on the graph theoretic technique and evaluated and analyzed using the Best Fit algorithm in the simulations. Although the total power consumption and average utility of both proposed algorithms are slightly impaired, the unnecessary outbound communication cost is significantly eliminated and decreased, especially in the immense number of services.

Since renewable energy sources have intermittent nature, we take advantage of migrating virtual machines to the nearby data centers with excess renewable energy. In particular, we first devise an optimal offline algorithm with full future knowledge of renewable level in the system. Since in practice, accessing long-term and exact future knowledge of renewable energy level is not feasible, we propose two online deterministic algorithms, one with no future knowledge called deterministic and one with limited knowledge of the future renewable availability called future-aware. We show that the deterministic and future-aware algorithms are 1+1/s and 1+1/s−ω/s.Tm competitive in comparison to the optimal offline algorithm, respectively, where s is the network to the brown energy cost, ω is the look-ahead window-size, and Tm is the migration time.

  abstract          = {To meet the growing demands on cloud services and applications, a sizeable number of large scale cloud data centers, hosting thousands of heterogeneous servers, is established by cloud service providers. The ever growth in establishing cloud data centers is accompanied by consuming enormous amounts of energy. Thus, proposing efficient management approaches to reduce the energy consumption in cloud data centers becomes a top priority for ensuring the scalability of the cloud computing architecture. In general, the main source of energy overconsumption in today's data centers is due to the inefficient use of the physical servers’ resources, which results in poor server utilization patterns. So, the key aspect is to utilize the physical resources optimally while serving the cloud user demands. This paper investigates the design and implementation of virtual machine management strategies for energy efficient cloud data centers. Particularly, it considers the processes of virtual machine placement and virtual machine consolidation in enhancing the energy efficiency in cloud infrastructures. While addressing the virtual machine placement problem is important, virtual machine consolidation is even more important to enable continuous reorganization of the already-placed virtual machines on the least number of physical machines. This results in reducing the number of active physical machines by leveraging live virtual machine migration enabled by the virtualization concept. Moreover, since the virtual machine migration operations consume additional energy, the frequency of VM migrations needs to be limited and controlled as well. The paper presents a distributed approach to an energy-efficient dynamic virtual machine consolidation mechanism. This approach determines, based on novel algorithms, which virtual machines to migrate, and when. Then, the placement of the virtual machines selected for migration is achieved based on a generalization of the Knapsack Problem known as the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem. The placement process suits both static and dynamic virtual machine placement. The results of the performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed new algorithms are able to enhance the energy efficiency in cloud data centers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Most of existing studies on the virtual machine migration, however are based on a single virtual machine migration. Although there are some researches on multiple virtual machines migration, the author usually does not consider the correlation among these virtual machines. In practice, in order to save energy and maintain system performance, cloud providers usually need to migrate multiple correlated virtual machines or migrate the entire virtual datacenter (VDC) request. In this paper, we focus on the efficient online live migration of multiple correlated VMs in VDC requests, for optimizing the migration performance. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient VDC migration algorithm (VDC-M).

  abstract          = {Today's Cloud applications are dominated by composite applications comprising multiple computing and data components with strong communication correlations among them. Although Cloud providers are deploying large number of computing and storage devices to address the ever increasing demand for computing and storage resources, network resource demands are emerging as one of the key areas of performance bottleneck. This paper addresses network-aware placement of virtual components (computing and data) of multi-tier applications in data centers and formally defines the placement as an optimization problem. The simultaneous placement of Virtual Machines and data blocks aims at reducing the network overhead of the data center network infrastructure. A greedy heuristic is proposed for the on-demand application components placement that localizes network traffic in the data center interconnect. Such optimization helps reducing communication overhead in upper layer network switches that will eventually reduce the overall traffic volume across the data center. This, in turn, will help reducing packet transmission delay, increasing network performance, and minimizing the energy consumption of network components. Experimental results demonstrate performance superiority of the proposed algorithm over other approaches where it outperforms the state-of-the-art network-aware application placement algorithm across all performance metrics by reducing the average network cost up to 67% and network usage at core switches up to 84%, as well as increasing the average number of application deployments up to 18%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract          = {Cloud computing datacenters consume huge amounts of energy, which has high cost and large environmental impact. There has been significant amount of research on dynamic power management, which shuts down unutilized equipment in a datacenter to reduce energy consumption. The main consumers of power in a datacenter are servers, communications network and the cooling system. Optimization of power in a datacenter is a difficult problem because of server resource constraints, network topology and bandwidth constraints, cost of VM migration, the heterogeneity of workloads and the servers. The arrival of new jobs and departure of completed jobs also create workload heterogeneity in time. As a result, most of the previous research has concentrated on partial optimization of power consumption, which optimizes either server and/or network power consumption through placement of VMs. Temporal load aware optimization, minimization of power consumption as a function of time has vastly been studied. When optimization also included migration, then solution had been divided into two steps, in the first step optimization of server and/or network power consumption is performed and in the second step migration of VMs has been taken care of, which is not an optimal solution. In this work, we develop joint optimization of power consumption of servers, network communications and cost of migration with workload and server heterogeneity subject to resource and bandwidth constraints through VM placement. Optimization results in an integer quadratic program (IQP) with linear/quadratic constraints in number of VMs assigned to a job on a server. IQP can only be solved for very small size systems, however, we have been able to decompose IQP to master and pricing sub-problems which may be solved through column generation technique for systems with larger sizes. Then, we have extended the optimization to manage temporal heterogeneity of the workload. It is assumed that time-axis is slotted and at the end of each slot jobs makes probabilistic complete/partial release of the VMs that they are holding and there will also be new job arrivals according to a Poisson process. The system will perform re-optimization of power consumption at the end of each slot that also includes the cost of VM migration. In the re-optimization, VMs of unfinished jobs may experience migration while new jobs are assigned VMs. We have obtained numerical results for optimal power consumption for the system as well as its power consumption due to two heuristic VM assignment algorithms. The results show optimization achieves significant power savings compared to the heuristic algorithms. We believe that our work advances state-of-the art in dynamic power management of datacenters and the results will be helpful to cloud service providers in achieving energy saving. © 2018, The Author(s).},

  abstract          = {Virtual machines use are increasing day by day as people are using many smart gadgets which are highly computing and for operating them smoothly, required virtual machines. Virtualization is the basic technique of creating various resources from the available physical infrastructure. It is the backbone of cloud computing technology. This paper try to deal with studying various techniques, models, algorithms, for efficient green cloud computing by using virtualization techniques. It mainly involves virtual machines(VMs) consolidation. Power utilization can be reduced by simply deactivating and reactivating physical machines to meet the current workload. Power awareness in distributed system can be defined as identifying the parameters which minimize the energy consumption along with better QOS, SLA. The various strategies discussed here are mainly focusing on saving power and making data centers more efficient by considering server and network as its scope, however in future due to requirement of high bandwidth and network connectivity of data centers, power requirement of data center will go beyond our imagination. To handle the above mentioned concern require actual study of how power consumption happens in data centers, most of the part of power are consumed by servers, CPU and switches i.e. network devices. There still lots of research need to be done to design such modern algorithm and techniques which achieve better energy efficiency along with consideration of QOS, SLA, and VM consolidation by defining VM topologies which are fault tolerant and also helps nature, mankind by minimizing Co2 emission. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {With the widespread usage of cloud computing to benefit from its services, cloud service providers have invested in constructing large scale data centers. Consequently, a tremendous increase in energy consumption has arisen in conjunction with its results, including a remarkable rise in costs of operating and cooling servers. Besides, increasing energy consumption has a significant impact on the environment due to emissions of carbon dioxide. Dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) into the minimal number of Physical Machines (PMs) is considered as one of the magic solutions to manage power consumption. The virtual machine placement problem is a critical issue for good VM consolidation. This paper proposes a Power-Aware technique depending on Particle Swarm Optimization (PAPSO) to determine the near-optimal placement for the migrated VMs. A discrete version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is adopted based on a decimal encoding to map the migrated VMs to the best appropriate PMs. Furthermore, an effective minimization fitness function is employed to reduce power consumption without violating the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Specifically, PAPSO consolidates the migrated VMs into the minimum number of PMs with a major constraint to decrease the number of overloaded hosts as much as possible. Therefore, the number of VM migrations can be reduced drastically by taking into consideration the main sources for VM migrations; overloaded hosts and underloaded ones. PAPSO is implemented in CloudSim and the experimental results on random workloads with different sizes of VMs and PMs show that PAPSO does not violate SLA and outperforms the Power-Aware Best Fit Decreasing algorithm (PABFD). It can reduce about 8.01%, 39.65%, 66.33%, and 11.87% on average in terms of consumed energy, number of VM migrations, number of host shutdowns and the combined metric Energy SLA Violation (ESV), respectively. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Power consumption is a primary concern in modern servers and data centers. Due to varying in workload types and intensities, different servers may have a different energy efficiency (EE) and energy proportionality (EP) even while having the same hardware configuration (i.e., central processing unit (CPU) generation and memory installation). For example, CPU frequency scaling and memory modules voltage scaling can significantly affect the server’s energy efficiency. In conventional virtualized data centers, the virtual machine (VM) scheduler packs VMs to servers until they saturate, without considering their energy efficiency and EP differences. In this paper we propose EASE, the Energy efficiency and proportionality Aware VM SchEduling framework containing data collection and scheduling algorithms. In the EASE framework, each server’s energy efficiency and EP characteristics are first identified by executing customized computing intensive, memory intensive, and hybrid benchmarks. Servers will be labelled and categorized with their affinity for different incoming requests according to their EP and EE characteristics. Then for each VM, EASE will undergo workload characterization procedure by tracing and monitoring their resource usage including CPU, memory, disk, and network and determine whether it is computing intensive, memory intensive, or a hybrid workload. Finally, EASE schedules VMs to servers by matching the VM’s workload type and the server’s EP and EE preference. The rationale of EASE is to schedule VMs to servers to keep them working around their peak energy efficiency point, i.e., the near optimal working range. When workload fluctuates, EASE re-schedules or migrates VMs to other servers to make sure that all the servers are running as near their optimal working range as they possibly can. The experimental results on real clusters show that EASE can save servers’ power consumption as much as 37.07%–49.98% in both homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, while the average completion time of the computing intensive VMs increases only 0.31%–8.49%. In the heterogeneous nodes, the power consumption of the computing intensive VMs can be reduced by 44.22%. The job completion time can be saved by 53.80%. © 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract          = {Migration of virtual machines (VMs) from one data center to another is essential to deal with scenarios such as load balancing, maintenance, power management, VM failures, etc. Application of VM migration is not only limited to a single cloud service provider, but also to inter-cloud architectures such as cloud federation. Migration in a federation is a complex operation as it encompasses many autonomous service providers with different standards, rules, and protocols. Migration can be carried out in two ways, first, live and, second, non-live. In case of live migration, a VM continues to execute at the source in contrast to non-live where its execution is suspended. In this paper, a framework for secure live migration of VMs in a cloud federation is proposed. Costs associated with it is analyzed for serial, parallel, and improved serial strategies. The proposed framework is simulated using a CloudSim simulator. Metrics considered for evaluation are communication overhead, migration time, and downtime. Further, power consumption for all strategies is calculated and compared. It is observed that downtime is least for parallel, whereas migration time is least for improved serial. The power consumption is highest for parallel and least for improved serial. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {The continuous advancement of cloud computing technology has driven the vigorous development of cloud data centers. This manifests itself not only in increasing numbers, but also in rapid expansion scale. At the same time, the problems of high energy consumption, high cost and high carbon emissions began to stand out. These factors have become a bottleneck restricting the further development of cloud computing technology. As a result of the application of virtualization technology, mature cloud service providers use virtual machines instead of physical machines to provide users with computing, storage and other services. Therefore, the scheduling algorithm of cloud tasks and virtual machines has been widely studied by academia as a core problem. However, most of the current cloud data center resource management algorithms take CPU utilization as the main consideration, and increase the CPU utilization through virtual machine integration to reduce the energy consumption of cloud data centers. However, these algorithms will cause waste and low utilization of other resources in the cloud data center due to excessive consideration of CPU utilization. This paper systematically analyzes the mapping relationship between cloud tasks, virtual machines and physical machines. At the same time, the performance of cloud tasks, virtual machines, and physical machines is modeled in the cloud data center. By comprehensively considering the CPU and memory characteristics of cloud tasks, the memory priority cloud task mapping rule is established. Based on the rule, the memory-aware resource management algorithm for low-energy cloud data centers (MALE) is proposed. The algorithm maps cloud tasks and deploys virtual machines according to the memory requirements of the cloud tasks, thereby achieving the goal of simultaneously reducing the total fee of cloud users and the energy consumption of cloud data centers. Finally, the algorithm is compared with the other three algorithms. The experimental simulation results show that the effect of the proposed algorithm in this paper is significantly better than the comparison algorithm for the total fee of cloud users and the energy consumption of the cloud data center. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract          = {The area of sustainable green smart computing highlights key challenges towards reducing cost and carbon dioxide emissions due to the high-energy consumption of Cloud data centres. Here, we focus on the Cloud virtual machine (VM) scheduling that is usually based on simple algorithms, e.g. VM placement on nodes with low memory usage. This approach fails to consider the actual configuration of nodes inside the server rack resulting in local overheating of Cloud data centres. To solve this, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the gravitational effect, called VMSAGE, to optimize energy efficiency of Cloud computing systems. Inspired by the physical gravitation model, we define the thermal repulsion and logical gravitation factors between physical nodes and VMs. To achieve optimized VM scheduling, we propose a gravitation function that refers to the calculation of the logical quality of each VM, host and rack through the algorithm, so as to draw the attractiveness between them. Based on the concept of dimension reduction, VMSAGE conducts the two-dimensional plane target selection twice to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, VMSAGE evaluates attributes of the computer room to carry out the VM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, we compare it with the Best Fit Heuristic (BFH) and the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithm achieves 10% and 20% optimized energy consumption respectively. The experimental results highlight our contribution, in where VMSAGE can significantly reduce energy consumption rates and VM migration times. © 2018},

  abstract          = {Resource allocation is an important problem for cloud environments. This paper introduces an energy-aware combinatorial auction-based model for the resource allocation problem in clouds. The proposed model allows users of a cloud to submit their virtual resource requests as bids using the provided bidding language which allows complementarities and substitutabilities among those resources to be declared. The model finds the most profitable mutually satisfiable set of winning bids, and the corresponding allocation of virtual resources to the users while considering the placement of virtual resources to the available physical resources in the cloud by executing an optimization problem. During the optimization, the model also takes account of the non-linear energy requirements of the physical resources based on their utilization levels to find a placement with the lowest energy cost, thus, providing an energy-aware solution to the resource allocation problem. The associated optimization problem is formally defined and formulated using integer programming. Since the optimization problem is intractable, four heuristic methods are also proposed. To evaluate the performance of the model and the proposed heuristic methods, several experiments are conducted on a comprehensive test suite. The results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model, and the high-quality solutions provided by the proposed methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Energy and carbon efficiency has become one of the most important research topics in the cloud computing research area because of the growing demand for cloud data center infrastructures. In addition to the environmental impact of emitting carbon, local authorities impose a carbon tax based on the amount of emitted carbon by the data centers. Therefore, this paper introduces the energy and carbon-aware initial VM placement (ECAIVMP), one of the most efficient strategies for minimizing the total energy consumption and carbon emission of cloud data centers without sacrificing the quality of service. Our proposed algorithm considers multiple geo-distributed cloud data centers and acknowledges both IT and non-IT power usage during the virtual machine placement process. An extensive simulation in the CloudSim Plus framework is conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm using real-world datasets, including workloads, power model benchmarks, and outside temperature. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce energy consumption by 17% and carbon emissions by 6% on average compared to other competitor algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract          = {With the massive demand and growth of cloud computing, virtualization plays an important role in providing services to end-users efficiently. However, with the increase in services over Cloud Computing, it is becoming more challenging to manage and run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) in Cloud Computing because of excessive power consumption. It is thus important to overcome these challenges by adopting an efficient technique to manage and monitor the status of VMs in a cloud environment. Reduction of power/energy consumption can be done by managing VMs more effectively in the datacenters of the cloud environment by switching between the active and inactive states of a VM. As a result, energy consumption reduces carbon emissions, leading to green cloud computing. The proposed Efficient Dynamic VM Scheduling approach minimizes Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations and manages VM migration by lowering the energy consumption effectively along with the balanced load. In the proposed work, VM Scheduling for Efficient Dynamically Migrated VM (VMS-EDMVM) approach first detects the over-utilized host using the Modified Weighted Linear Regression (MWLR) algorithm and along with the dynamic utilization model for an underutilized host. Maximum Power Reduction and Reduced Time (MPRRT) approach has been developed for the VM selection followed by a two-phase Best-Fit CPU, BW (BFCB) VM Scheduling mechanism which is simulated in CloudSim based on the adaptive utilization threshold base. The proposed work achieved a Power consumption of 108.45 kWh, and the total SLA violation was 0.1%. The VM migration count was reduced to 2,202 times, revealing better performance as compared to other methods mentioned in this paper. Copyright ©2022 KSII},

  abstract          = {Virtual machine (VM) migration is an indispensable aspect of a virtualized cloud environment. It assists in resource management by dynamically relocating VMs from one physical machine to another. This is an essential aspect especially for big data applications that are prone to variable workloads and often demand relocation of resources in terms of VMs. However, such applications not only experience stochastic workloads but also have stringent requirements on the maximum tolerable latency. To address such issues, VMs are often relocated using live VM migration. VM migration is associated with overheads, hence, in this paper, we propose a modified serial migration strategy to migrate multiple VMs based on the pre-copy live migration technique. We propose to interleave the pre-copy stages in such a way that a balance is achieved between the migration time and downtime overheads. The proposed technique is compared with the state-of-the-art serial, parallel, and improved serial migration strategies. Concerning downtime, the proposed approach performs exceptionally well compared to both serial and improved serial methods. The downtime of the proposed scheme and parallel are comparative for read-intensive applications (low dirtying rates). However, for write-intensive applications (high dirtying rates) the former significantly outperforms the latter. The migration time performance of the proposed scheme is observed to be much better than that of the parallel technique and is slightly higher than those of serial and improved serial techniques. © 2021},

  abstract          = {On-demand computing ability and efficient service delivery are the major benefits of cloud systems. The limitation in resource availability in single data centers causes the extraction of additional resources from the cloud providers group. The federation scheme dynamically increases resource availability in response to service requests. The dynamic increase in resource count leads to excessive energy consumption, maximum cost, and carbon footprints emission. Hence, the reduction of resources is the major requirement to construct the optimized cloud source models for profit maximization without considering energy mix and CO2. This paper proposes the novel migration method to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption. The initial stage in the proposed work is the categorization of data centers based on the MIPS and cost prior to job allocation offers scalable and efficient services and resources to the cloud user. Then, the job with the maximum size is allotted to the VM only if its capacity is less than the cumulative capacity of data centers. A novel migration based on overutilized and underutilized levels provides the services to the user even if the particular VM fails. The proposed work offers efficient maintenance of resource availability and maximizes the profit of the cloud providers associated with the federated cloud environment. The comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm with the existing methods regarding the response time, accuracy, profit, carbon emission, and energy consumption assures the effectiveness in a confederated cloud environment.

  abstract          = {Cloud computing is a new computation technology that provides services to consumers and businesses. The main idea of Cloud computing is to present software and hardware services through the Internet to the users and organizations at all levels. In Cloud computing, the users pay for the services, which means a usage-based payment system is used in this technology. Using virtualization technology in computation resources enables the appropriate utilization of resources in cloud computing. One of the most significant challenging issues in virtualization technology is the placement of optimal virtual machines on physical machines in cloud data centers. The placement of virtual machines comprises a process wherein virtual machines are mapped onto physical machines in cloud data centers. Optimal deployment leads to the reduction in power consumption, optimal use of resources, traffic reduction in data centers, costs reduction, and efficiency enhancement of the data center in the cloud. The present article proposed a new approach using a combination of the Sine–Cosine Algorithm and Salp Swarm Algorithm as discrete multi-objective and chaotic functions for optimal virtual machine placement. The first goal of the proposed algorithm was to reduce the power consumption in cloud data centers by condensing the number of active physical machines. The second goal was to reduce the waste of resources and manage it by optimally virtual machine placement on physical machines in cloud data centers. The third objective was to minimize and reduce Service Level Agreement among the active physical machines in cloud data centers. The proposed method prevent the increase in the migration of virtual machines onto physical machines. Ultimately, the results obtained from the proposed algorithm were compared with those of previous akin algorithms in the literature, including First Fit, Virtual Machine Placement Ant Colony System, and Modified Best Fit Decreasing. The proposed scheme is tested using Amazon EC2 Instances and the result indicated that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing algorithms for various performance metrics. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract          = {Cloud computing provides a service-oriented computing model to cloud users on a metered basis. Most of the cloud data centers are running on fossil fuels. It elevates the carbon emissions to the environment. Green cloud computing is the fusion of greenness in cloud computing to address the issues related to energy consumption and environmental sustainability. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation and live migration can provide standard solutions to energy consumption. The selection of VM for migration is a vital task. It should be performed effectively to trade-off between energy consumption and service level agreement violation (SLAV). The research activity in this article focuses on a new VM selection policy that chooses VM with high energy consumption and small size. Real-world workload traces were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed MECpVmS VM selection policy. Using CloudSim simulation, the MECpVmS VM selection policy has been implemented and assessed with existing VM selection policies. The results show an overall improvement in energy efficiency, energy consumption, SLAV. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Given the performance and efficiency optimizations realized by the computer systems and architecture community over the last decades, the dominating source of computing's carbon footprint is shifting from operational emissions to embodied emissions. These embodied emissions owe to hardware manufacturing and infrastructure-related activities. Despite the rising embodied emissions, there is a distinct lack of architectural modeling tools to quantify and optimize the end-to-end carbon footprint of computing. This work proposes ACT, an architectural carbon footprint modeling framework, to enable carbon characterization and sustainability-driven early design space exploration. Using ACT we demonstrate optimizing hardware for carbon yields distinct solutions compared to optimizing for performance and efficiency. We construct use cases, based on the three tenets of sustainable design---Reduce, Reuse, Recycle---to highlight future methods that enable strong performance and efficiency scaling in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

We predict a combined growth of data center electricity needs of 286 TWh in 2016 until about 321 TWh in 2030, if all currently known growth factors remain the same. We next run simulations for the end of Moore’s law and the growth of industrial Internet of Things (IoT). The end of Moore’s law results in about 658 TWh for 2030 and an increase of the share of global data center electricity consumption from about 1.15% in 2016 to 1.86% in 2030. A rise of the Industrial IoT may result into total energy consumption of about 364 TWh (about 1.03%) in 2030. Moore’s law and IoT combined cause data center energy needs going up to 752 TWh in 2030, and about 2.13% of global electricity available. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the future impact of the data centers’ electricity consumption is vulnerable to behavioral usage trends, since the 95% confidence interval of [343, 1031] TWh is relatively wide. Our forecasts, however, exclude the energy needs of mobile devices, edge and fog computing. We offer a system dynamic model and simulation input data selected from the existing literature for replicating this study and applying alternative parameters to it. We further suggest multiple research directions on usage impact on data center energy consumption.}
